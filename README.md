# CodeRefactor
The first thing i noticed while reviewing the website was the Search Engine Optimization link was not working, so i checked the html and i noticed that it did not have a id written in it.
The title tag did not have the name of the website.The Hero class on line 36 was was between a div tag i changed it to have them be between a figure tag.The html did not have any comments.Line 39 class also was in a div tag instead of a main tag.
No alt attributes in any image elements.line 96 was in a div tag instead of a aside tag.No footer tag in the footer section.For the css no comments was present.
Hero class's background size did not have contain.Completely missing all 6 img class's.classe's was all over the place and not paired in sections.
